            <h2>THE ELEPHANT</h2>
            <p><i>The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth, known for its long trunk, large ears, and tusks made of ivory. There are three main species â€” the African savanna elephant, African forest elephant, and Asian elephant. Elephants are intelligent, social animals that live in herds, communicate through sounds and vibrations, and have excellent memory. They are herbivores, feeding on grass, leaves, bark, and fruit. Sadly, elephants face threats from habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts important to protect them.

            <h2>THE PENGUIN</h2>
            <p><i>Penguins are flightless seabirds found mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Antarctica. They have black-and-white plumage that helps with camouflage in water (called countershading) and strong flippers for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers and can dive deep to catch fish, squid, and krill. They live in colonies and are known for their unique courtship behaviors and lifelong mating pairs in some species. Despite being birds, they cannot fly and instead "fly" through water with remarkable speed and agility.</i></p>

                <h1>THE DOLPHIN</h1>
                <p><i>Dolphins are intelligent marine mammals found in oceans and some rivers around the world. They have streamlined bodies and use their fins and tails to swim swiftly. Dolphins breathe air through a blowhole on top of their head and communicate using clicks and whistles. They are social animals, living in groups called pods, and are known for their playful behavior and problem-solving skills. Their diet mainly includes fish and squid.</i></p>
